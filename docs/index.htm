	<h1>We have a new toy for AC fans!</h1>
	<p>Whether you trade gifts just on your main or have many fuel rings to maintain, tracking gifts can become difficult and time consuming.<br>
	Speadsheets can do the job sure, but quickly get out of hand and bloated especially as your game count increases.</p>	<h2>Introducing ACgifts</h2>	<p>A simple app that keeps count of gifts sent and recieved, sorted by groups (such as fuel rings) </p>
	<p>Neighbors can be imported via CSV file or directly entered and edited in app.</p>
	
	<h4>Free and open source</h4>
	<p>The project is hosted on GitHub and contributors are very wellcome. Contact me via the <a href="https://www.airportcitygame.com/members/crash-and-burn.29038/#about" target="_blank">forum</a> to request access to the repo.<br>
	The published files are signed by my own certificate, so you know only I can make updates to the installed app no matter who adds features.<br>
	But the best feature of open source code is you can view it, compile it and modify it to your liking, and I encourage you to do so!<br>
	This repo compiles in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2022</a> community (free) without a single warning or reccomendation.</p>
	
	<h4>Quick and easy setup</h4>
	<p>Packaging and deployment using Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce" target="_blank">ClickOnce</a> technology enables simple install
	without requiring elevated priviledges (non-admin) along with automatic and rapid updates.<br>
	Microsoft .NET6 is required, but you will be directed during install if your PC does not have it already. (if not find it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.22-windows-x64-installer" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
	Be forewarned you will recieve <a href="faq.htm#warnings">multiple warnings</a> before install because I created my own certificates without paying a 'trusted authority' that only confirms my identity, not how trustworthy the code signed is.</p>
