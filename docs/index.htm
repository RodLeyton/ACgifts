	<h1>We have a new toy for AC fans!</h1>
	<p>Wether you trade gifts just on your main or have many fuel rings to maintain, tracking gifts can become difficult and time consuming.<br>
	Speadsheets can do the job sure, but quickly get out of hand and bloated especially as your game count increases.</p>	<h2>Introducing ACgifts</h2>	<p>A simple app that keeps count of gifts sent and recieved, sorted by groups (such as fuel rings) </p>
	<p>Neighbors can be imported via CSV file (template supplied) or directly entered and edited in app.</p>
	
	<h4>Free and open source</h4>
	<p>The project is hosted on GitHub feel free to assist in the development. 
	Although I will not be spending much more time adding features.</p>
	
	<h4>Quick and easy setup</h4>
	<p>Packaging and deployment using Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce">ClickOnce</a> technology enables simple install
	without requiring elevated priviledges (non-admin) along with automatic and rapid updates.</p>
	<p>Microsoft .NET6 is required, but you should be directed during install if your PC does not have it already. (otherwise find it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.22-windows-x64-installer">here</a>)</p>
