		<h1>We have a new toy for Airport City fans!</h1>
		<p>Whether you trade gifts just on your main, or have many fuel rings to maintain, 
			tracking neighbors and gifts eventually becomes difficult and time consuming.<br>
			Of course speadsheets can do the job, but you too will likely find they get out of hand and bloated, 
			especially as your game count increases.<br>
			And naturally the larger the spreadsheet gets, the longer it takes.</p>
		<p>Maybe you don't care what you recieve, but just want to keep track of who you should send to 
			knowing that AC favourites cannot be trusted to do the job.</p>
		<p>Does your spreadsheet keep count of gifts, does it remember the last time one was sent, how about recieved?<br> 
			Will it <b>warn you</b> if you drop off your neighbors Fav's list? 
			We know that can happen quite unexpectantly for no reason.<br>
			How about if your neighbor dissapears off your fav list through no fault of your own? Nobody wants to be that guy...</p>
		<p>Or have you just given up and relinquished to the 'fact' that it is just too much to do, and "close enough is good enough"?</p>
		<p>Maybe you (like me) wrote macros for buttons, but it still had so many columns it took up almost all the screen, 
			and in a moment of unclarity accidentally clicked the wrong one...<br>
			Can your spreadsheet undo it? Neighter could mine... but Acgifts can!</p>		<h2>Introducing ACgifts</h2>		<p>A simple and very lightweight windows app (~700kb) app that keeps count of gifts sent and recieved, 
			sorted by groups (such as fuel rings)<br>
			Neighbors can be imported via CSV file or directly entered and edited in app.<br>
			And it is easier, faster and much much smaller on the screen (try resizing to minimum width - it still has all you need!)</p>
		
		
		<h4>Free and open source</h4>
		<p>The project is written in C# and hosted on GitHub and contributors are very wellcome. 
			Contact me via the <a href="https://www.airportcitygame.com/members/crash-and-burn.29038/#about" target="_blank">forum</a> 
			or Discord to request write access to the repo.<br>
			The best feature of open <a href="https://github.com/RodLeyton/ACgifts" target="_blank">source code</a> is you can view it, compile it and modify it to your liking, and I encourage you to do so!<br>
			You don't even have to ask to do so, just download and go for it! (But I hope you'd contribute and help to improve it)<br>
			This repo compiles in <a href="https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/free-developer-offers/" target="_blank">Visual Studio 2022</a> 
			community (free) without a single warning or code quality reccomendation.</p>
		
		<h4>Quick and easy setup</h4>
		<p>Packaging and deployment using Microsoft <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ClickOnce" target="_blank">ClickOnce</a> 
			enables simple install without requiring elevated priviledges (non-admin) along with automatic and rapid updates.<br>
			Microsoft .NET6 is required, you will be directed during install if your PC does not have it already. 
			(if not find it <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/thank-you/runtime-desktop-6.0.22-windows-x64-installer" target="_blank">here</a>)<br>
			Be forewarned you will recieve <a href="faq.htm#warnings">2 warnings</a> during install (Unrecognised app and Unknown Publisher). 
			Free software can be expensive to write if you pay for a EV code signing certificate.</p>
