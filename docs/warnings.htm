	<h1>What are there all these warnings when installing?</h1>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<p>Basically I'm too cheap to pay for a certificate. But then again would you pay for one?<br>
	This is a not for profit project, and I don't mean like all thouse other non-profits that take in millions per year.<br>
	Lets not forget you have the ability to compile the <a href="https://github.com/RodLeyton/ACgifts" target="_blank">source code</a> yourself without a single warning.<br>
	Even then a security certificate only verifies identity, not the code signed by it.<br>
	In fact if I had paid for one the issuer would have no idea what I had signed with it, never test the application or be aware in any way they had removed the warnings you are likely concerned about.<br>
	Lets look at the warnings...</p>
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
		
	<h2>Windows protected your PC, Unrecognised app prevented from starting</h2>
	
	<div class="imgLeft">
		<img src="smartscreen.png">
		<span>The warning is "I haven't seen this app before"<br>
		Considering I just made it, we cannot be surprised.<br>
		However throw some money at it and they'll recognise it real fast.<br>
		To continue just click 'More info' on this warning and select 'Run anyway'.<br>
		But before you do, have a quick read <a href="https://www.advancedinstaller.com/prevent-smartscreen-from-appearing.html" target="_blank">here</a> as to why this warning comes up and the 2 teirs of speed and cost to remove it.

	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2>Publisher cannot be verified</h2>

	<div class="imgLeft"><img src="not_verified.png">
		<span>I'd like to point out in todays era of big data Microsoft and Google know more about me than I do.<br>
		But not enough to Verify me apparently.<br>
		Of course the installer is a Microsoft product, built by a Microsoft product tied to my account by a Microsoft email<br>
		to which I need to use my phone (which in my country is tied to my drivers license) to log into.<br>
		And here we are on a Microsoft operating system also tied to my Microsoft account yet aparently Microsoft cannot verify my identity.<br>
		However paying a 3rd party will fix all that??? OK I've finished ranting!
		</span>

	<h2>But why did my anivirus not pick this up?</h2>
	<p>Well my best guess is because the app doesn't contain any virus or malware!</p>
