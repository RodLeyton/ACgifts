		<h2 id="import">Importing neighbors via CSV file</h2>
		<p>A template file for the csv format can be found <a href="import template.csv">here</a>. It is also in the application directory (you can find that with the Dir button on the edit form).<br>
		Please refer to this file in a text editor if you're having import issues, it has many examples of acceptable formats including special characters and dates.</p>
		<p>The easiest way to edit csv files is in a spreadsheet application such as MS Excell or LibreOffice/Openoffice Calc.<br>
		If any errors occur you will recieve a message directing you to check the <a href="faq.htm#errorLog">error log</a></p>
		
		<h3>Fields in the csv file</h3>
		<h5>Name</h5>
		<p>This is the forum or acual name of your neighbor, currently it is only displayed as a tooltip when you hover over the game names, in the future I may add a details panel</p>
		
		<h5>Group</h5>
		<p>Either a fuel ring name, or something like main. If blank will be grouped under 'unassigned'.</p>

		<h5>NameSend / NameRecv</h5>
		<p>The game name of the account you send to or receive from. Obviously these are different in fuel rings, but they may be the same on your main account.</p>
		
		<h5>CodeSend / CodeRecv</h5>
		<p>At present these are not displayed, and may be left empty. However in future an extra details form may be added.</p>
		
		<h5>LastSend / LastRecv</h5>
		<p>The date and time of the last gift sent and recieved. This may be left blank, or be a <a href="#datetime">valid format</a><p>
		
		<h5>CntSend / CntRecv</h5>
		<p>The count of gifts sent and recieved since this neighbor was added. If left blank defaults to 0.<br>
		This value is used to calculate the gifting rate (or reliability) and should reflect to the number of gifts since the date in the 'Added' field.<br>
		In other words, if you specify the neighbor was added 10 days ago (and they gift every day) the count shoud be 10.<p>
		
		<h5>Added</h5>
		<p>The date and time this neighbor was added to your list. This may be left blank, or be a <a href="#datetime">valid format</a><br>
		If left blank it will default to the current date. This value to used to calculate the gifting rate (or reliability).<p>
		
		
		<hr>
		<h2 id="datetime">Valid date time formats</h2>
		<p>All <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings" target="_blank">standard formats</a> are accepted, some of which depend on your locale, along with many non-standard variations.<br>
		Take note any locale dependent formats differ depending on what location your computer is set to. This is by design and usually is a very helpfull convenience.<br>
		For example the short date format '01/02/2023' will refer to Janurary in the US and Feburary in France. 
		If you stick to what is normally used in your country (and your computers locale is correct) you should be fine.<br>
		If any date time that fails to parse correctly during an import you will be notified, and the logfile will contain the specific line number and contents that caused the issue.<br>
		The log file can be found <a href="#errorLog">here</a><br>
		It is worth pointing out that when using a spreadsheet if you set the cell format to a datetime type (instead of text) you should avoid any hassle as it will format it correctly for your locale,<br>
		which means it will be parsed correctly by ACgifts based on your locale.</p>
		<p>Some examples follow</p>
		
		<h5>Short date <span class="bad">(locale dependant)</span></h5>
		<ul>
			<li>US - MM/dd/yyyy</li>
			<li>France - dd/MM/yyyy </li>
			<li>Japan - yyyy/MM/dd</li>
			<li>Denmark - dd.MM.yyyy</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h5>General date time <span class="bad">(locale dependant)</span></h5>
		<ul>
			<li>Short date (as above) with time  e.g. in the US &nbsp; 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm'</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h5>ISO 8601 (universal standard)</h5>
		<ul>
			<li>yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss &nbsp; e.g. 2023-01-20T09:30:00 => 20 Jan 2023 9:30 am</li>
		</ul>
			
		<h5>Non-standard formats</h5>
		<p>Most unambigous natural language formats will also work, such as;
		<ul>
			<li>'April 10, 2023' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
			<li>'1 march 2023 9pm' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
			<li>'1 mar 2023 6am' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
			<li class="bad">'1st march 2023 9pm' - fails to parse! (Don't use st,nd,rd,th after the day)</li>
			<li class="bad">'half past a sparrows fart' - I believe this only works in the Australian outback.</li>
		</ul></p>

		<h2 id="errorLog">Where can I find the logfile?</h2>
		<div class="imgLeft">
			<img src="log_button.png">
			<span>Logs are located in your local application directory, under CrashnBurn subfolder.<br>
			Usually this is 'C:\Users\[name]\AppData\Local\CrashnBurn\ACgifts_Release\log-release.txt'<br>
			The exact location will depend on your OS, but the easiest way to find it is to click the Dir or Log buttons on the Edit form.<br>
			When the primary log reaches 250kB it is moved to 'log-release.bak.txt' and a new file is started.</span>
		</div>
		<p>If you have any issues, please copy this file at the time and provide a description of what you were doing when asking for help.</p>

		<hr>
		<h2 id="refund">What if I don't like it, can I get a refund?</h2>
		<p>Of course, we offer a same day 100% (including postage and packaging) refund on your purchase price!<br>
		Please note this refund does not include any other costs you may have incured, including but not limited to veterinary bills, airfares, car insurance, etc<br>
		Considering the upfront cost of $0 including postage and packaging (only avaliable via download) it is an absolute bargain!</p>

		<hr>
		<h2 id="warnings">What are all these warnings when I install it?</h2>
		<p>Basically I'm too cheap to pay for a certificate. But then again would you pay for one?<br>
		This is a not for profit project, and I don't mean like all thouse other non-profits that take in millions per year.<br>
		Lets not forget you have the ability to compile the <a href="https://github.com/RodLeyton/ACgifts" target="_blank">source code</a> yourself without a single warning.<br>
		Even then a security certificate only verifies identity, not the code signed by it.</p>
		<p>Lets look at the warnings...</p>
			
		<h3>Windows protected your PC, Unrecognised app prevented from starting</h3>
		<div class="imgLeft">
			<img src="smartscreen.png">
			<span>The warning is "I haven't seen this app before"<br>
			Considering I just made it, it is to be expected.<br>
			To continue click 'More info' and select 'Run anyway'.<br>
			But before you do, have a quick read <a href="https://www.advancedinstaller.com/prevent-smartscreen-from-appearing.html" target="_blank">here</a> as to why this warning comes up and the 2 teirs of speed and cost to remove it.
			</span>
		</div>
		<p>Alternatly right clicking the 'setup.exe' file and selecting properties, you will see "This file came from another computer...", check unblock and this warning will go away.</p>
		<p>The real issue is everytime an update is released any recognition from SmartScreen is lost, unless thousands of people are installing the app it is unlikely this warning will go away.</p>
		<p>&nbsp;</p>

		<h3 id="warnings">Publisher cannot be verified</h3>
		<div class="imgLeft"><img src="not_verified.png">
			<span>To verify a publisher a code signing certificate must be used, not exactly a cheap proposition considering this is a free app from a private person.</span>
		</div>

		<hr>
		<h3 id="data">Why are there so many .dat files?</h3>
		<p>Safety of data is the top priority! Every time the app is started a backup of the previous sessions data is saved.<br>
		These are rotated so the largest number	(max 30) is the oldest.<br>
		Normally this should cover the last month, so we have plenty of options to recover data if anything goes wrong!<br>
		In addition, before a restore or import a backup is automatically created named 'ACgifts_backup_pre...' since this occurs unfrequently these are never deleted.<br>
		The main data file is 'neighbors.dat' everything else can be deleted (even 'app.config')</p>
