	<h1>Importing neighbors via CSV file</h1>
	<p>A template file for the csv format can be found <a href="import template.csv">here</a>. It is also in the application directory (you can find that with the Dir button on the edit form).<br>
	Please refer to this file, it has many examples of acceptable formats.</p>
	<p>The easiest way to edit csv files is in a spreadsheet application such as MS Excell or LibreOffice/Openoffice Calc.<br>
	If any errors occur you will recieve a message directing you to check the <a href="faq.htm#errorLog">error log</a></p>
	
	<h2>Fields in the csv file</h2>
	<h5>Name</h5>
	<p>This is the forum or acual name of your neighbor, currently it is only displayed as a tooltip when you hover over the game names, in the future I may add a details panel</p>
	
	<h5>Group</h5>
	<p>Either a fuel ring name, or something like main. If blank will be grouped under 'unassigned'.</p>

	<h5>NameSend / NameRecv</h5>
	<p>The game name of the account you send to or receive from. Obviously these are different in fuel rings, but they may be the same on your main account.</p>
	
	<h5>CodeSend / CodeRecv</h5>
	<p>At present these are not displayed, and may be left empty. However in future an extra details form may be added.</p>
	
	<h5>LastSend / LastRecv</h5>
	<p>The date and time of the last gift sent and recieved. This may be left blank, or be a <a href="#datetime">valid format</a><p>
	
	<h5>CntSend / CntRecv</h5>
	<p>The count of gifts sent and recieved since this neighbor was added. If left blank defaults to 0.<br>
	This value is used to calculate the gifting rate (or reliability) and should reflect to the number of gifts since the date in the 'Added' field.<br>
	In other words, if you specify the neighbor was added 10 days ago (and they gift every day) the count shoud be 10.<p>
	
	<h5>Added</h5>
	<p>The date and time this neighbor was added to your list. This may be left blank, or be a <a href="#datetime">valid format</a><br>
	If left blank it will default to the current date. This value to used to calculate the gifting rate (or reliability).<p>
	
	<p>&nbsp;</p>
	<h2 id="datetime">Valid date time formats</h2>
	<p>All <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/base-types/standard-date-and-time-format-strings" target="_blank">standard formats</a> are accepted, some of which depend on your locale.<br>
	Take note any locale dependent formats differ depending on what location your computer is set to. This is by design and usually is a very helpfull convenience.<br>
	For example the short date format 01/02/2023 will refer to Janurary in the US and Feburary in France. 
	If you stick to what is normally used in your country (and your computers location is correct) you should be fine.<br>
	It is worth pointing out that when using a spreadsheet if you set the cell format to a datetime type (instead of text) you should avoid any hassle as it will format it correctly for your locale.</p>
	<p>Some examples follow</p>
	
	<h5>Short date <span class="bad">(locale dependant)</span></h5>
	<ul>
		<li>US - MM/dd/yyyy</li>
		<li>France - dd/MM/yyyy </li>
		<li>Japan - yyyy/MM/dd</li>
		<li>Denmark - dd.MM.yyyy</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h5>General date time <span class="bad">(locale dependant)</span></h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Short date (as above) with time  e.g. in the US &nbsp; 'MM/dd/yyyy HH:mm'</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h5>ISO 8601 (universal standard)</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>yyyy-MM-ddThh:mm:ss &nbsp; e.g. 2023-01-20T09:30:00 => 20 Jan 2023 9:30 am</li>
	</ul>
		
	<h5>Non-standard formats</h5>
	<ul>
		<li>Most normal language formats will also work so long as it is unambigous</li>
		<li>'April 10, 2023' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
		<li>'1 march 2023 9pm' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
		<li>'1 mar 2023 6am' - works as expected in any locale.</li>
		<li class="bad">'1st march 2023 9pm' - fails to parse!</li>
		<li class="bad">'half past a sparrows fart' - only works in the Australian outback.</li>
	</ul>
